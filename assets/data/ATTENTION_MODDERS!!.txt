Make sure to also add the hitsound sounds in assets/sounds/hitsounds when adding custom hitsounds (the game will crash if you dont, you have been warned)

--|| skinPack ||--
(literally same as hitsoundPack)
Make sure to also add the skin stuff in assets/images/skins when adding custom skins



|| SKINS ||
Skins use the new loading system, with an exception. All assets in ''assets/<week>/X'' should be put in ''skin/X'', instead of ''skin/<week>/X''
Assets allowed in skins, currently: images, music, sounds
(make sure to leave credit when using other mod's assets!)
